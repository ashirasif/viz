# VIZ
Python script to visualizes music using monitor. I wanted to make it with LED strips but was too broke to buy them (still am).

## Requirements
+ Pygame for python3
+ Sounddevice for python3

## Arguments
All the arguments are optional.
__fps__ : define the fps of animation. Default is 30.
__size__ : size of the screen. Default is (1920, 1080).
__threshold__ : threshold for determining color. default is 20000.

You'll gonna have to experiment with it to get the right one. Default value is ok tho.

run with -h flag for help
